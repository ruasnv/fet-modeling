"""This is a crucial module for preparing data for the GANs and then using the trained GANs for augmentation. It should contain functions for:

Segregating your processed data into subsets for each operating region.

Generating synthetic data using the trained Generators for minority classes.

Combining the original data with the newly generated synthetic data to create the balanced dataset."""
